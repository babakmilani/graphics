1. NO IDENTITY SPACE (NoIS): This was an idea I helped conceptualize. The initial idea was to create a brand that represents a community of people that
   create art in the form of fashion that hold no identity boundaries.

2. This is a brand name that I helped conceptualize from the Kr√©ole meaning Kombit that means, " community effort ". The domain is a website for
   a non-profit organization in New York that help struggling families with the essential necessities.
